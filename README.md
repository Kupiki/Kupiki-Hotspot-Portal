What is Kupiki Hotspot Portal
==================

This project is a basic captive portal that could be used with Coova Chilli

It's full part of the project [Kupiki-Hotspot-Script](https://github.com/pihomeserver/Kupiki-Hotspot-Script) that builds automatically a full wifi hotspot on a Raspberry Pi 3

The current template is based on the [codepen](https://codepen.io/suez/pen/dPqxoM) from @suez (Nikolay Talanov)
